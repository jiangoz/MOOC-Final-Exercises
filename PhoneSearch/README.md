>Let's create an application to manage people phone numbers and addresses.
1 adding a phone number to the relative person
2 phone number search by person
3 name search by phone number
4 adding an address to the relative person
5 personal information search (search for a person's address and phone number)
6 removing a person's information
7 filtered search by keyword (retrieving a list which must be sorted by name in alphabetic order), the keyword can appear in the name or address
